## Data Mining Projects in other Platforms
These projects are performed using data mining and modeling techniques in other platform such as H2O and JMP Pro. Just for interesting attempts.

### House Prices Prediction
We	Conducted data exploration, cleaning and feature engineering on 79 variables describing 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa using scikit-learn in python and developed models using H2O automachine learning with Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error of 0.13 on validation data.

### Churn Analysis
Conducted data exploration, feature engineering Built and compared logistic, decision tree and neural network models to predict company churn rate using JMP Pro and provided solutions to improve customer retention.
