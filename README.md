## Modeling Projects Using other Tools
These modeling projects are performed using tools other than traditional packages in R or Python. I tried H2O, JMP Pro and Spark MLlib to build various models. They also show good results. Just for interesting attempts.

### House Prices Prediction
Conducted data exploration, cleaning and feature engineering on 79 variables describing 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa using scikit-learn in python and developed models using H2O automachine learning with Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error of 0.13 on validation data.

### Churn Analysis
Conducted data exploration and feature engineering in JMP Pro and tried logistic, decision tree and neural network models to predict company's churn rate and finally selected decision tree model with highest ROC of 0.88. It drew a lot of useful business insights so that we can provide solutions to improve customer retention.

### 2013 NYC Taxi Tipping Prediction
Conducted feature exploration and developed logistic regression model in Spark MLlib to predict taxi tipping with ROC of 0.98.
